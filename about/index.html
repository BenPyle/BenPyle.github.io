	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p> I'm Ben Pyle, an economics Ph.D. student and recent J.D. graduate at the University of Michigan. I'm on the 2022-2023 law faculty market. </p>
	
<p> My primary research goal is to shape and inform legal practices to improve outcomes after contact with the criminal justice system and to reduce the disparities the legal system generates. I am particularly focused on the relationship between the criminal justice system and employment. Seeking to improve post-conviction outcomes has led me to research policies upstream from a conviction within criminal law and downstream within employment law. </p>
