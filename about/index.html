	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p> I'm Ben Pyle, an economics Ph.D. student and recent J.D. graduate at the University of Michigan.
My primary research goal is to shape and inform legal practices to improve outcomes after contact with the criminal justice system and to reduce the disparities the legal system generates. I am particularly focused on the relationship between the criminal justice system and employment. Seeking to improve post-conviction outcomes has led me to research policies upstream from a conviction within criminal law and downstream within employment law.
