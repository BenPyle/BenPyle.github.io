<p> About the author: I'm Ben Pyle, an economics student graduate student at the University of Michigan.
I general work in labor or law and economics topics, although much of my background is macro and monetary.
When I'm not working on economics (and sometimes while I am...) I'm generally making bad jokes, 
playing a sport, or doing something outside. <b/>
About the page: This webpage is mostly serving as a fun way for me to learn 
a bit about Jekyll, javascript, etc., in hopes that they will eventually be a useful pedagogical tool. </p>
