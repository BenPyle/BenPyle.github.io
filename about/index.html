	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p> <b>About the author:</b> I'm Ben Pyle, an economics graduate student at the University of Michigan.
I like to work on labor or law and economics topics, although much of my background is in macro and monetary.
When I'm not working on economics (and sometimes while I am...) I'm generally making bad jokes or doing something outside. </p>
<p><b>About the page:</b> This webpage is mostly serving as a fun way for me to learn 
a bit about Jekyll, Javascript, etc., in hopes that they will eventually be useful pedagogical tools for me. </p>
