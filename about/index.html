	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p> I'm Ben Pyle, an Associate Professor Boston University school of Law. I'm a lawyer and economist focused on empirical legal studies. </p>
	
<p> My primary research goal is to inform legal practices to improve outcomes after contact with the criminal justice system and to reduce the disparities the legal system generates. I am particularly focused on the relationship between the criminal justice system and employment. Seeking to improve post-conviction outcomes has led me to research policies upstream from a conviction within criminal law and downstream within employment law. </p>
