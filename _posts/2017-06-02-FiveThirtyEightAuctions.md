In this post I rewrite some notes from my game theory course to solve the ["how much should you bid" Riddler.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-should-you-bid-for-that-painting/)

## Problem set-up
The premise for the problem is you are bidding against your arch-rival for a painting. You each have a valuation for the painting drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 100,000,000. You each submit a sealed bid, with a winner pay format, first price format.
